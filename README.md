## 💾 Data Storage

All designs are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`. This means:
- ✅ No backend required
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Fast and private
- ⚠️ Data is browser-specific (not synced across devices)

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Image Embedding
When sharing designs, you can choose which information to embed at the bottom of the image:
- Selected information appears in a styled banner
- Text is optimized for readability
- Brand badge included
- High-quality JPEG output

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Prevents accidental zoom on input focus
- Safe area insets for notched devices
- Native share API support
- Optimized image rendering for mobile performance

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## 📝 Notes

- The app uses browser localStorage, so data persists across sessions
- WhatsApp sharing works best on mobile devices with native share support
- All images are processed client-side for privacy
- No external API keys or services required
